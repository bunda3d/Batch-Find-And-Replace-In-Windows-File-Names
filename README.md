Then save the script in the folder containing the files you want to change.

Click on it, and watch all your file names update.

# Change the Find and Replace parameters 
The script is currently set to change all instances of "2020" to "2019", but you can change that to whatever.

If you change the "Folder Location" path, your script doesn't have to be saved in the folder with the changing files.

# Actually performs batch find-and-replace of partial file names.
Does not simply rename multiple files the same filename, as can already be done in the Windows 10 Windows Explorer with the "Rename" feature.
